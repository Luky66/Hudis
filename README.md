# Hudis
Get to know who's calling you.

## Word deriviation and pronounciation
Pronounciation: (/huːdɪs/)
- Who: /huː/
- this: /ðɪs/
- dis (slang): /dɪs/

## What is this?
It's an iOS App that let's you find out who called you using the Swiss adressbook API from [search.ch](https://tel.search.ch).

## The current state: Development discontinued and project deprecated
The development on this small project of mine was stopped after the exact idea for this app was published by local.ch. 
- Google Play: [Swiss Phone Book](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.local.android)
- App Store: [local.ch](https://itunes.apple.com/ch/app/swiss-phone-book/id300110733?l=de)

They improved it quite a lot as well, since they have access to the data and I only had the API, which would have ment the user needed an API key for himself.

So check out their app if you have the same struggle as I did.

## Why this name?
Who this? Who dis? Whodis? Hudis? That's why.
